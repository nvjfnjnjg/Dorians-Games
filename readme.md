# I love all your shit talkin'
I love all your shit talkin'
You ain't got nothin' better to do with yourself
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin' myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real
It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through better days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate (grab a plate)
Check the date (check the date), let 'em hate (let 'em hate)
This the type shit that they couldn't make (couldn't make)
Watch the fakes (watch the fakes)
Leave 'em buzzin', thought they wasn't, huh? (Huh?)
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh? (Huh?)
This is the package you ordered, huh? (Huh?)
Beautiful madness
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
